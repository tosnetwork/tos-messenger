# Open decisions

The architecture leaves a set of choices to the M0 protocol freeze. Code cannot
wait for all of them, so where an implementation was required a concrete
proposal was made. Each one is recorded here with the code that implements it,
so a freeze decision changes a known place rather than an unknown one.

Changing any item below is a wire-format change. `pkg/identity` carries a fixed
digest vector for exactly this reason: an accidental change breaks a test rather
than silently forking two implementations.

| Decision | Proposal in this repository | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Messaging Endpoint identifier derivation | `mep_` + SHA-256 over a domain-separated preimage of the network tuple, Agent ID, and endpoint public key | `identity.DeriveEndpointID` |
| Delegation authenticity | No separate signature. A delegation is authentic when its canonical digest appears in the finalized Agent's committed delegation digests | `identity.Verify` |
| Delegation lifetime bound | at most 365 days; session lifetime within 60 seconds to 30 days and never longer than the delegation | `identity.validateWindowFields` |
| Descriptor lifetime bound | at most 7 days, and never beyond the delegation expiry | `directory.ValidateDescriptor`, `directory.Bind` |
| DHT key derivation | SHA-256 over a domain-separated preimage of the network-bound Agent digest and endpoint identifier | `directory.LookupKey` |
| DHT value size bound | 1024 bytes encoded; retrieval reference at most 512 bytes | `directory.MaxLocatorBytes` |
| Locator retrieval schemes | `https`, `adnl`, `rldp`, and `http` on loopback only | `directory.validateDescriptorLocator` |
| Envelope size bounds | advertised maximum between 4 KiB and 1 MiB; stored ciphertext at most 1 MiB | `directory.MinEnvelopeBytes`, `envelope.MaxCiphertextBytes` |
| Relay retention bound | at most 30 days, and never beyond the operator's own bound | `envelope.AcceptedForStorage` |
| Event ID derivation | content addressed: `evt_` + SHA-256 over the canonical event preimage excluding the identifier itself | `envelope.DeriveEventID` |
| Event kind to delegated class mapping | explicit table; an unrecognised kind has no class | `envelope.eventClasses` |
| Event body bounds | content at most 128 KiB, 16 causal parents, 16 attachment references | `envelope` constants |
| Durable store format | one JSON record per event in a private directory owned by one process, forward-only state machine | `pkg/eventlog` |

## Not proposed here

These remain entirely open, and this repository deliberately contains no
implementation of them:

- the one-to-one end-to-end encryption suite and library, and the hybrid
  post-quantum migration schedule;
- the group key-management protocol, where MLS (RFC 9420) is the recorded
  default candidate that an alternative must be justified against;
- private-room transport, beyond the per-device fan-out default;
- first-contact admission parameters, including whether an economic bond is
  used, which the current fixed-price software-work escrow cannot express;
- prekey publication, replenishment, and equivocation detection;
- Mailbox Relay sender privacy, quota tokens, and anti-spam model;
- mobile push privacy within the contentless wake-up constraint; and
- public channel ordering and moderation policy.
